3_65_0_0	3	Initial Computerized Sorting of Contest Entries: After the conclusion of the Contest Submission Period, Sponsor will use a computer model to sort all Contest Entries based upon the commonality (high frequency) of the Toppings included and the uniqueness (low frequency) of the Toppings included. The sorting of the Contest Entries will result in an array of Whopper Ideas where the Toppings range from the most common Toppings to the most unique Toppings. Within the array, the model will sort the Whopper Ideas into three “Groups” as follows:1. Whopper Ideas with most common Toppings,‍2. Whopper Ideas with the most unique Toppings, and3. Whopper Ideas with a relatively equal combination of common and unique Toppings.2. Judging Panel Review: A panel of qualified judges with subject matter expertise, determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, will review the Groups of Whopper Ideas, and utilize the following criteria to select one Whopper Idea from each Group, each a MDW Contender:1. Feasibility: The Feasibility score will be based on the operational ease and practicality of incorporating the Toppings contained in the Whopper Idea. Evaluation criteria includes ingredient availability, sourcing, cost, and operational ease (i.e., preparation time, food storage requirements, compatibility with existing equipment and compliance with food safety/public health regulations and standards). The Feasibility Score is worth 40% 2. Innovation: The Innovation score of the Whopper Idea is based on its culinary creativity (i.e., how well it captures authentic flavors and highlights specific culinary traditions with a new twist, or combines Toppings in unexpected ways), its inventive taste profile, and visual appeal. The Innovation Score is worth 30%.3. Popularity: The Popularity score is based on the expected appeal of the Whopper Idea to most Burger King customers. The Popularity Score is worth 30%. 4. Sponsor will not disclose any judging scores.3. Random Drawing To Select Finalists: Sponsor expects that there will be multiple Entrants who submitted Contest Entries that are the same or substantially similar to the three MDW Contenders selected by the Judges. If so, Sponsor will aggregate all Contest Entries that match or are substantially similar (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion) to each MDW Contender. Prize Administrator will conduct random drawings including all Contest Entries that are the same or substantially similar to the applicable MDW Contender in order to select a potential Finalist to represent each MDW Contender Odds of being selected as a potential Finalist depend upon the number of Entrants who submitted the same or substantially similar Contest Entry for each respective MDW Contender. If there is only one single Entrant who has submitted a Contest Entry for a particular MDW Contender, then this Entrant will be deemed a potential Finalist.	0_0	food	burgerking.txt

Within the array, the model will sort the Whopper Ideas into three “Groups” as follows:1. Whopper Ideas with most common Toppings,‍2. Whopper Ideas with the most unique Toppings, and3. Whopper Ideas with a relatively equal combination of common and unique Toppings.2. Judging Panel Review: A panel of qualified judges with subject matter expertise, determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, will review the Groups of Whopper Ideas, and utilize the following criteria to select one Whopper Idea from each Group, each a MDW Contender:1. Feasibility: The Feasibility score will be based on the operational ease and practicality of incorporating the Toppings contained in the Whopper Idea. Evaluation criteria includes ingredient availability, sourcing, cost, and operational ease (i.e., preparation time, food storage requirements, compatibility with existing equipment and compliance with food safety/public health regulations and standards). The Feasibility Score is worth 40% 2. Innovation: The Innovation score of the Whopper Idea is based on its culinary creativity (i.e., how well it captures authentic flavors and highlights specific culinary traditions with a new twist, or combines Toppings in unexpected ways), its inventive taste profile, and visual appeal. The Innovation Score is worth 30%.3. Popularity: The Popularity score is based on the expected appeal of the Whopper Idea to most Burger King customers. The Popularity Score is worth 30%. 4. Sponsor will not disclose any judging scores.3. Random Drawing To Select Finalists: Sponsor expects that there will be multiple Entrants who submitted Contest Entries that are the same or substantially similar to the three MDW Contenders selected by the Judges. If so, Sponsor will aggregate all Contest Entries that match or are substantially similar (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion) to each MDW Contender. Prize Administrator will conduct random drawings including all Contest Entries that are the same or substantially similar to the applicable MDW Contender in order to select a potential Finalist to represent each MDW Contender Odds of being selected as a potential Finalist depend upon the number of Entrants who submitted the same or substantially similar Contest Entry for each respective MDW Contender. If there is only one single Entrant who has submitted a Contest Entry for a particular MDW Contender, then this Entrant will be deemed a potential Finalist.	0_2	food	burgerking.txt
