Explanation for chunkingPreprocess.py:

The file chunkingPreprocess.py is a Python script that preprocesses text documents for efficient information retrieval using a technique called embedding and indexing. Here's a high-level explanation:

What it does:

Loads and chunks documents: It reads text documents from a specified folder and splits them into smaller chunks of text. This is done to handle potentially large documents and make the embedding process more manageable.
Embeds chunks: It uses a pre-trained language model (SentenceTransformer) to generate numerical representations (embeddings) for each chunk. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text chunks.
Creates a FAISS index: It uses the FAISS library to create an index that stores these embeddings efficiently. The index allows for fast similarity search, enabling you to quickly find chunks that are semantically similar to a given query.
Saves the index and metadata: The script saves the FAISS index and metadata (information about the document, section, subsection, and file name) to disk. This allows you to load and use the index for information retrieval later.
Why you would use it:

This script is a key component in building a semantic search system, which allows you to search for information based on meaning rather than just keywords. Here are some scenarios where you would use it:

Large document retrieval: If you have a large collection of documents, using embeddings and an efficient index allows you to quickly find relevant documents based on semantic queries.
Question answering: You can use the embedded index to answer questions by finding the most relevant text chunks.
Document summarization: You can use the embeddings to identify the most important chunks in a document and generate a concise summary.
In essence, chunkingPreprocess.py prepares your text data for efficient and semantic-aware information retrieval by:

Breaking down large documents into manageable chunks.
Converting the chunks into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture meaning.
Storing these embeddings in an optimized index for fast similarity search.
